    <h2 id="title">About Boruto</h2> 
    Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (Japanese: BORUTO-ボルト- -NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS- Hepburn: Boruto: Naruto Nekusuto Jenerēshonzu)
    is a Japanese manga series written by Ukyō Kodachi and illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto. Serialised monthly in Shueisha's
    shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, Boruto is a spin-off and a sequel to Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto, which follows
    the exploits of Naruto Uzumaki's son, Boruto Uzumaki, and his ninja team. An anime television series adaptation directed
    by Noriyuki Abe started airing on TV Tokyo on 5 April 2017. Unlike the manga, which began as a retelling of the film
    Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015), the Boruto anime begins as a prequel set before Boruto and his friends become ninjas
    in a later story arc. A series of light novels have also been written.
    <br>
    <br> Boruto originated from Shueisha's proposal to Kishimoto on making a sequel to Naruto. However, Kishimoto rejected this
    offer and proposed his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto to draw it; the writer of the Boruto film, Ukyō Kodachi, created
    the plot. While both Kodachi and Ikemoto are in charge of the manga, Kodachi also oversees the anime's adaptation alongside
    Kishimoto.
